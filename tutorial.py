Tutorial System - Main Entry Point

This module provides the public API for the tutorial system.
It was previously missing, causing all tutorial_event() calls to fail.

Public Functions:
- start_tutorial(): Start the tutorial from beginning or resume
- tutorial_event(event_name): Handle tutorial events for progression
- skip_tutorial(): Skip the tutorial entirely
